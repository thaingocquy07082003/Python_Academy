Fullscreen instructions for `dino-runner`:
- The game now starts in fullscreen by default.
- Press F11 to toggle fullscreen on/off.
- Press ESC to exit fullscreen (or quit if already windowed).

If you want to start windowed by default, edit `setup_display(fullscreen=True)` in `dino-runner/main.py`.
